    <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
    <div>
        <p>This privacy statement outlines the information collected and how it is used by the Auto Upload script.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collected</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Folder Path: The directory path provided by the user for video files.</li>
            <li>Default Upload Title: The default title entered by the user for video uploads.</li>
            <li>Default Upload Description: The default description entered by the user for video uploads.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Usage of Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Folder Path: Used to locate video files for upload.</li>
            <li>Default Upload Title: Used as the default title for video uploads.</li>
            <li>Default Upload Description: Used as the default description for video uploads.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. YouTube API Credentials</h2>
        <p>The script requires YouTube API credentials for authentication. The provided credentials file (secret.json) is used exclusively for this purpose.</p>

        <h2>4. Storage of Information</h2>
        <p>User-provided information is stored locally in a configuration file (config.json) to maintain user preferences across script runs. YouTube API credentials are stored in a token file (token.pickle) to enable automatic authentication for subsequent runs.</p>

        <h2>5. Video Uploads</h2>
        <p>Video files are uploaded to YouTube using the provided API credentials. Uploaded videos may be set as private or public, as specified by the user.</p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>All stored information, including API credentials, is kept securely on the user's machine. The script does not transmit any user data to external servers.</p>

        <h2>7. OBS Integration</h2>
        <p>The script checks for the running status of OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) using the OBS WebSocket. No data is collected from OBS; the check is solely for integration purposes.</p>

        <h2>8. Third-Party Libraries</h2>
        <p>The script uses third-party libraries, including Google API libraries and OBS WebSocket, for functionality. Refer to their respective privacy policies for more information.</p>

        <h2>9. Consent</h2>
        <p>By using the Auto Upload script, you consent to the collection and use of information as outlined in this privacy statement.</p>

        <h2>10. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>For any questions or concerns regarding privacy, you may <a href="mailto:chaxprivate@gmail.com">contact us</a>.</p>
